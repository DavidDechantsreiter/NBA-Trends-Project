# NBA Trends Project
 In this project, I analyzed data from the NBA (National Basketball Association) and explored possible associations.   This data was originally sourced from 538's Analysis of the [Complete History Of The NBA](http://fivethirtyeight.com/interactives/the-complete-history-of-every-nba-team-by-elo) and contains the original, unmodified data from [Basketball Reference](http://www.basketball-reference.com/) as well as several additional variables 538 added to perform their own analysis.   You can read more about the data and how it's being used by 538 [here](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/nba-elo). For this project I've limited the data to just 5 teams and 10 columns (plus one constructed column, `point_diff`, the difference between `pts` and `opp_pts`).
